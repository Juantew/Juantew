## 👋 Hi, I'm Juante — Machine Learning Engineer (Entry-Level)

I'm an aspiring Machine Learning Engineer with a strong foundation in Python, applied machine learning, and end-to-end project development. I focus on building practical ML systems that solve real-world problems — from fraud detection to computer vision to recommender systems.

## 🔍 What I’m Working On

### 🚀 Current ML Portfolio Projects
- **Credit Card Fraud Detection (Logistic Regression + XGBoost)**  
  Full end-to-end, imbalanced classification project with threshold tuning.
- **Movie Recommendation System (Collaborative + Content-Based)**  
  Personalized recommendations using embeddings and similarity search.
- **Image Classifier (TensorFlow CNN)**  
  Deep learning model for multi-class image classification.
- **Spam Detection with NLP**  
  ML pipeline using text preprocessing, TF-IDF, and logistic regression.

### 📚 Continuing To Build
- Expanding my ML portfolio to 3–5 complete deployable projects.
- Integrating AWS services (Lambda, S3, SageMaker) into ML workflows.
